>Summary of the speech by Paolo Russo, president of CRHACK LAB F4D, in the Aula Magna of the Faculty of Economics of the University of Perugia at the presentation of the NeXT Hackathon of the Solidarity Economy on 7 October 2019.

To innovate means to implement a process of change that leads to improvement for a community, broadly understood from the small local organisation to the large unstructured informal network.

Trying to be an Innovator means continuously cultivating one's incompetencies. The more incompetent one becomes, the more one is in a position to innovate. It means being exposed to the new in massive doses.

The Innovator's dilemma is to choose between trying to change the past or trying to change the future. In the first case he tries to change the laws and rules. In the second he tries to change the culture. Culture always precedes Law.

CRHACK LAB FOLIGNO 4D was born to change culture. The culture of digital.

How?

First of all, we want to create dependence on innovative thinking.

We use the Art of Crowdreaming, a method designed to turn an individual's dream into a story shared by enough people for it to be turned into reality through a rigorous production process inspired by that of the great Hollywood films. The idea is that if a project has worked, then it has a success story. With the Art of Crowddreaming we start by imagining the desirable happy ending and reconstruct backwards the success story that must have led us there. Then we try to produce it in reality.

We are trying to imagine the Invisible City's Inexistent Professions: four-dimensional director, indeterministic scriptwriter, stigmergic teacher, chaotic photographer, diffuse stylist, connective musician, quantised curator, third-millennium amanuensis...

We operate by creating concrete projects along three main programming axes:

- We explore the future of entertainment and edutainment with the creation of the interactive StoryWorld ‘Calls from the Other Side’, based on the story ‘The Three Rings’;

- We explore the future of publishing, particularly school publishing, with the augmented reality of ‘It's Bigger on the Inside’;

- We explore the future of heritage appreciation and professional scenario management training through the immersive environments of the programme ‘All the World's a Stage’.

Along this road we continuously come across professions that do not yet exist and use the elements we observe to define new professional profiles and start training young people in them

In practice, we are organised as a voluntary association running an Open Lab, where we give members free access to augmented and virtual reality technologies, involving them in real projects with the support of a multidisciplinary team of mentors. It is important to emphasise that the lab has a strongly localised nature: in a future dominated by fantastic but homologising machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, the cultural specificity of the invididuo and its ability to improvise novel solutions must be cultivated. This is why in our name, in addition to the reference to Crowddreaming and the laboratory nature, there are also references to hacking and to our city.

In some ways you could say that at CRHACK LAB FOLIGNO 4D we are inventing the Craftsmen of the Third Millennium, the artisans who will urbanise the invisible digital dimension of reality.

And, who knows, maybe we are inventing your craft too.
