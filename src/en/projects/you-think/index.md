### **Empowering Youth with Digital Literacy and Critical Thinking**	

**4th November 2024**

This November, **YouTHink**, an international project aimed at developing the digital literacy and critical thinking skills of young people aged 14-19 years old, is launching an international project to promote responsible and safe browsing in the digital space.		

The rapid dissemination and abundance of information on websites, blogs, and social networks create conditions for the spread of various disinformation and fake news.				

According to [**Eurostat data**](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20230714-1), in 2022, 84% of young people (16-29 years old) used the internet for social networking, and as many as 94% of young people used the internet. Therefore, this audience often encounters various content that can be propaganda, fake news, disinformation, AI-generated content for malicious purposes, and so on. In the [**Eurostat survey**](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20240529-3) on checking the reliability of content, it was found that only 36% of young people of the same age tried to check the accuracy of information or content found on the Internet in other sources.

This 26-month **YouTHink** project takes an innovative approach to media and information literacy education. It is expected that the use of gamification methods, virtual immersive tasks, and digital tools will increase youth engagement and encourage motivation to learn about media and information literacy. At least 200 young participants and 40 youth workers from partner countries will be invited to participate in the project, who will test the developed training material and actively contribute to its creation.  
"Information published in the digital space poses increasing challenges that require a responsible approach and media literacy skills," says project coordinator Renata Danielienė. "We believe that the YouTHink project will not only strengthen young people's digital resilience, but will also help them better understand the impact of media, develop critical thinking, encourage young people to become responsible citizens of the digital society, and encourage them to create reliable content."  
				  
The project brings together five organisations from Lithuania, Portugal, Slovenia and Italy, pooling their experience in innovative teaching methods and digital skills.  
We invite you to follow the project news and participate in project activities.
