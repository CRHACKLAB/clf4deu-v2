yamlProjectValue: ArteMIA is the project line of CHRACK LAB F4D that explores the potential of the combination of Digital Technologies and Art as a Means for Inclusion and Accessibility. ArteMIA is about making museums more accessible and welcoming by writing guides based on the *Easy to Read* method for writing texts that people with cognitive disabilities can read and understand. It is also to collaborate with social cooperatives to include people with cognitive disabilities in the process of conception and creation of the itinerary, which will be realised following the rules of the *Easy to Read* approach and applying the Methodology devised by the Erasmus+ project ACCEASY, Easy to Read, Easy to Access offering them an opportunity for personal growth through the full enjoyment of museums.

### ArteMIA-Art for Inclusion and Accessibility - Guide to CIAC Poles

The objective of the ArteMIA Project-Guide to the CIAC Poles is to create an Accessible Itinerary for and with people with cognitive disabilities, to discover the works housed within the CIAC and the Cosmic Magnet, permanently exhibited at the Former Church of the Holy Trinity in Annunziata. The proposal to create a Guide/Itinerary of the CIAC poles stems from the desire to open the museum spaces to the widest possible public and from the awareness that, too often, Contemporary Art is left aside because it is considered too complex or elitist.  The realisation of the Accessible Guide allows not only to bring new audiences to the museums, but also to create a product that can potentially be used by everyone to guide and inform them in their discovery of the CIAC.
