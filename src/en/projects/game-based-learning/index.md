yamlProjectValue: With this project, the partner organisations aim to provide knowledge, pedagogical approaches, appropriate teaching materials and technical tools to teachers, not only in the partner countries, but throughout Europe. Teachers are trained in new trends imposed by modern educational needs and, in particular, in **game-based learning methods and the use of gamification in the educational process**. In addition, within the project, a **digital guide** will be developed in the form of a wiki, which will contain all the material needed to assist teachers in integrating these methods.

#### How

The course teaches how to make educational activities more effective through the use of gamification. 
It covers topics such as traditional games, role-playing games (RPG), board games, LEGO and digital and video games. A specific focus is on social and educational games.

#### Objectives

To integrate game design elements into educational-pedagogical areas. The latest observations and research have indeed shown that gamification offers many benefits when used appropriately. After all, everyone likes to play, and the fundamental concept behind the game is precisely involvement, which can help learners in learning and teachers in acquiring new tools to integrate into their educational systems.
