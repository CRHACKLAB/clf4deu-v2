#### Objectives

To acquire the necessary tools and inspiration for the creation of projects aimed at enhancing the local cultural heritage. 

#### Results

In Lisbon, topics were addressed for the creation of 3 works on the link between the city of Amelia and Cinema; Well-being linked to the consumption of extra virgin olive oil; Embroidery as a tool for uniting peoples. 
In Wertheim, Germany, 1 project was developed based on the twinning of the German city with Gubbio, to promote cultural exchanges also involving schools in Gubbio in order to enhance the two cultures and the twinning itself. The last project took us to Viborg, Denmark, where the idea of a Slow Tourism Guide was studied, through the creation of itineraries and practical advice, designed specifically for people over 65.
