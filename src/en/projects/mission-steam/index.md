#### Objectives

To demonstrate how gender roles are formed at this age based on exposure to media and popular culture. For example, talking about science with friends and engaging in science activities during childhood is predictive in later career choice. 

The research - *Implementing STEAM in the Early Childhood Classroom* - states that providing hands-on, meaningful STEAM experiences for early childhood and primary school children has a positive impact on their perceptions and dispositions towards creative learning of technology and science subjects.

#### State
