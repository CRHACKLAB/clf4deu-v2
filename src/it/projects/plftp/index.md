#### How?

Through ICT, students will have the opportunity to combine the real world with three-dimensional virtual objects, to interact and collaborate in a curious way, using their knowledge through the possibilities offered by multimedia approaches. Cultural heritage and technology encourage cooperation and coexistence of peoples through the identification and transmission of common elements, cultivating in learners tolerance for differences and the importance of diversity, freeing them from future xenophobic syndromes, stereotypes and prejudices.

#### Objectives

To strengthen the European dimension through interculturality and an understanding of the fact that technology does not distort tradition, but on the contrary, with appropriate manipulations and techniques, emphasises it through the combination of the virtual and real worlds.
